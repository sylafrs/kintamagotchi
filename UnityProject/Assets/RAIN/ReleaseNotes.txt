RAIN version 2.1.8.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------

What's New:
-----------
We've added support for our new line of Sentio(tm) Characters.  
Sentio Characters are pre-rigged, completely ready to go characters that you can drag and drop into your game for instant functionality.  Look for Sentio Characters coming to the Unity Asset Store very soon, and check our website and social media to stay up to date.  http://rivaltheory.com

Changes and bug fixes:
----------------------
RAIN menus have been reorganized for simplicity and for support of Sentio Characters.
AI now shows the Mind in the first tab position in the inspector.
Fix for BasicNavigator choosing the wrong path waypoint when smoothing paths, which caused AI to skip ahead.
Fix to path smoothing in general, wasn't working properly when the smoothing changed significantly.
Fix for terrain collider collector not accounting for height properly on the terrain.
Added a TransformNavMesh call to move the entire navigation mesh and recalculate bounds appropriately.
Added RecalculateBounds call to NavMeshPoly in the event that the underlying graph vertices have changed.
Added a few more functions to the NavMeshPathGraph for adding contours and vertices manually.
Added public setter for AIRig.AI property.
Added more support for custom AI editors.
Added support for sliders in the RAIN editor.
Revamped the Sensor system:
--Sensors can return Any, All, Best matches.  For built-in sensors, "Best" means nearest object.
--Sensors can be consistent and keep the same object when returning only one object. When the "Consistent" box is checked in the Detect node, the sensor will continue returning the same object until it goes out of range.  If the box is not checked, the matched object may change based on "Best"/nearest or randomly for "Any".
--Sensors have an updated code API.  The previous API has been deprecated but will be supported up to RAIN 2.2.
--Sensors no longer support filters (deprecated).
--Added PhysicalSensor as the base class for most sensors.
Added list accessors to objects managed by NavigationManager (Waypoints, NavigationTargets, Graphs)
Fixed undo when creating AI for the first time.
Added creation helper to RAINScriptableObject (API).
Added creation helpers to WaypointRig (API).
Switched metrics ping to 12 hours.
